Whitefield provides a simulation environment for wireless sensor network by combining realistic RF simulation with the native mode use of popular IoT stacks/OSes such as Contiki/RIOT/OpenThread. Thus one can use existing stack implementation as is and test it on top of realistic RF simulation.

Typical use of Whitefield:

1. Large scale testing of sensor networks
2. Large scale interop testing between multitudes of stacks in same wireless environment. It can scale to thousands of nodes on general purpose server (even laptops).
3. Validate RF phy/mac simulation against each other. For e.g. compare results in NS3 vs Castalia
4. Regression tests using IdealAir(future).
